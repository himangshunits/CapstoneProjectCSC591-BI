1. Why were the original algorithms bad?
2. Why we need clustering-speed, size, meaning of recommendations.
3. How many kind of clustering can be done? User Clustering and Item clusteriing
4. Item clustering gives diversty, user clustering gives similarity.
5. Some do either ways, some do both.
6. We did the interesting thing of modelling with respect to user optimism and pessimism.
7. What are the goods?()
8. What are the bads? introducing bias in the system. If done the same for items, what will happen?
9. Future Work : Refine the criteria of pessimism. The people who give bad ratings on very famous and enjoyed items are the pessimists!
