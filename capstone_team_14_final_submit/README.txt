# The following libraries has to be installed which are available as pip packages : numpy, pandas, igraph

# Description of the Code Files:
# build_graph.py : used to build graphs from user item matrix, currently not being used in the main flow.
# build_similarity_matrices.py : Used to compute various similiraty matrices between users.(stores the matrices in numpy arrayas in files *.npy)
# create_user_item.py : to build the user item matrix, stores in csv file called user_item.csv
# *_clustering.py : Implements various clustering methods corresponding to different similarity measures.
# centroid_generation.py : Used to fidn the centroids as described in the reference paper.
# recommendation_*.py : Used to evaluate the models on the known ratings.
# recommendation_topk.py : ;reccomends top k movies to the user which he has not seen.


# Code Running instructions 
# The matrices and the user item matrix are already generated as described above.
# If you want to generate the matrices, just run the codes build_similarity_matrices.py, create_user_item.py
# To build the models and evaluate, set the K values in the scripts named recommendation_*.py and run.
# If you want recomendation for top k movies using the algorithm describes, run the recommendation_topk.py
